# WriteBee: Your On-Device AI Assistant

## ‚ú® Inspiration
The idea behind WriteBee was born from a simple need: to harness the power of **artificial intelligence** directly within the browser, without relying on external platforms or sending sensitive data to the cloud. Our goal was to create a **Chrome extension** that acts as an intelligent, privacy-first text assistant. We were inspired by how people consume and create information ‚Äî across **YouTube, Gmail, LinkedIn, X (Twitter), Outlook, and GitHub** ‚Äî and wanted to bring AI assistance right where productivity happens.

## üöÄ What it does
WriteBee is a comprehensive AI toolkit integrated directly into your browser. All processing is done **100% on your local device**, ensuring your data remains private.

- **Core AI Actions**: Instantly **summarize, translate, rewrite, explain, or expand** any selected text on any webpage.
- **Contextual Page Chat (RAG)**: Have an intelligent conversation with the current web page or a PDF document. Ask questions, get summaries, and find information using a built-in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** engine.
- **Multimodal Capabilities**:
    - **Image Understanding**: Right-click an image to **describe it, extract its text (OCR)**, or summarize its visual content.
    - **Voice-to-Text**: Use your microphone to **dictate prompts** directly into the chat instead of typing.
- **Platform Integrations**: Access AI tools seamlessly within the websites you use most, including **Gmail, Outlook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and GitHub**.
- **Creative Assistant**: Use the side panel chat for general-purpose conversation, brainstorming, and content creation.
- **Prompt Library**: Save and organize your favorite prompts for quick and easy reuse.

## üîß How we built it
WriteBee is a **Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)** built with modern web technologies, centered around the new **Chrome AI API**.

- **On-Device AI Core**: The extension's brain is the `chrome.ai` API, leveraging the built-in language model for all text generation tasks (`summarize`, `translate`, `chat`, etc.). This allows all AI processing to happen locally, ensuring user privacy.
- **Client-Side RAG Engine**: We built a lightweight **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** engine from scratch in JavaScript. This engine:
    - **Chunks** web page or PDF content into manageable pieces.
    - **Vectorizes** these chunks using a custom **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** implementation.
    - **Retrieves** the most relevant chunks based on your query using **cosine similarity** and injects them as context for the AI model.
- **Multimodal Pipeline**: We integrated image and audio processing using the multimodal capabilities of the `LanguageModel` API.
    - For images, we process blobs to perform **OCR** and **image description**.
    - For audio, we capture microphone input using the `MediaRecorder` API, and send the resulting audio blob for **transcription**.
- **Modular Architecture**: The codebase is organized into modules for each major feature (e.g., `ai.js`, `ragEngine.js`, `multimodal.js`, `gmail.js`, `youtube.js`). A central `content.js` script injects these features, while `side_panel.js` manages the main chat interface.
- **PDF Processing**: We integrated **PDF.js** to extract text content from local PDF files, allowing the RAG engine to index and chat with them.
- **UI & State Management**: The UI is built with plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, featuring a floating toolbar for in-page actions and a responsive side panel for chat. `chrome.storage.local` is used to persist the chat history and user settings.

## üöß Challenges we ran into
- **Handling Large Contexts**: Summarizing lengthy articles or video transcripts required implementing a **hierarchical chunking strategy**, where text is broken down, summarized in parts, and then the summaries are combined for a final result.
- **Ensuring User Privacy**: This was our biggest motivation. The solution was to commit fully to **on-device processing** by using the `chrome.ai` API and building our own client-side RAG engine, ensuring no user data ever leaves the machine.
- **Manifest V3 Restrictions**: Service workers have limited lifespans and no DOM access. We used the `chrome.offscreen` API to create a temporary, hidden document to perform complex background tasks.
- **Microphone Permissions**: Getting microphone access within a side panel is complex. We engineered a solution where the recording is initiated from the active page's content script, which then passes the audio data to the side panel for transcription.

## üèÜ Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **A Truly On-Device AI Assistant**: We successfully built a feature-rich AI tool that runs entirely locally, a significant step forward for user privacy in the age of AI.
- **A Custom JavaScript RAG Engine**: Building a functional, client-side RAG system from scratch using TF-IDF vectorization was a major achievement that enables powerful contextual conversations.
- **Seamless Multimodal Integration**: We are proud of creating a smooth user experience for interacting with images (OCR, description) and voice (transcription) as fluidly as text.
- **Broad Platform Integration**: The extension feels like a native feature on multiple major websites, which required careful engineering of the content scripts.

## üéì What we learned
- The power and potential of the **Chrome AI API** for building privacy-centric applications.
- How to implement core information retrieval concepts like **TF-IDF and cosine similarity** to build an effective, lightweight RAG system in JavaScript.
- Strategies for managing **permissions, service workers, and cross-context communication** within the constraints of Manifest V3.
- The importance of a modular design to manage the complexity of integrating dozens of features into a single, coherent product.

## üîÆ What's next for WriteBee
- **Enhanced RAG Engine**: We plan to explore using the Chrome AI API to generate embeddings for our RAG engine, potentially moving from TF-IDF to a more powerful semantic search.
- **Expanded Integrations**: We aim to support more platforms, such as Slack, Discord, and popular developer forums.
- **Deeper Workflow Integration**: Instead of just providing text, we want to enable actions, like auto-composing and sending email replies in Gmail.
- **Community Prompt Library**: Allow users to share and discover useful prompts within the extension.
